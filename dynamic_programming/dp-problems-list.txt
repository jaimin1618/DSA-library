Solving these 7 problem patterns will enable you to solve 70 DP problems. No doubt about it!

1) 0-1 KnapSack
	- Subset sum
	- Equal sum partition
	- Count subset sum
	- Minimum subset sum different (Solid problem!)
	- Count number of subset sum with given difference 
	- Target sum (Tricky question!)

2) Unbounded KnapSack
	- Rod cutting
	- Coin change
		- # of ways coin change
		- Minimum coins required coin change (Interesting! look into this for many twists!)
	- Longest common subsequence
	- Longest common substring
	- Print LCS
	- Shorted common supersequence
	- Minimum number of insertion and deletion to convert string a to b
	- Longest palindromic subsequence
	- Minimum number of deletion in string to make it palindrome
	- Print shortest common supersequence
	- Longest repeating subsequence
	- Sequence pattern matching
	- Minimum number of insertion in a string to make it palindrome

3) Matrix Chain Multiplication (Solid topic!)
	- Palindrome paritioning 
	- Evaluate expression to true boolean parenthesization
	- Scrambled string
	- Egg dropping problem
